    <h3>Biography</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      My name is Olawale John, a native of Ijebu Ode in Ogun State
      Nigeria. I hold a Bachelor of technology degree in Urban and Regional
      planning from the Federal University of Technology, Akure. Presently,I am
      simultaneosly pursuing a MSc degree in Applied Geoinformatics at the
      University of Salzburg, Austria and a Diploma certificate in Backend
      Engineering at AltSchool Africa. I currently work part-time as a Kitchen
      Assistant in three star hotel here in Salzburg city. I have previously
      work as a Data officer at 54gene and Relationship Manager in Wema Bank
      both in Nigeria. I hope to transition fully to a Backend Engineering role
      in the next one year.

    <h3>Why I joined Altschool</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      I joined Altschool to transition into the in-demand IT industry. With its
      exceptional course offerings and reviews from friends and online, I
      believe Altschool is the perfect fit for me. The program will equip me
      with the skills needed for a successful career in software development. I
      am excited to leverage Altschool's expertise and resources to kickstart my
      journey in IT. i already have very bascic knowledge of Python, R and SQL
      and with Altschool's guidance, I am confident that I will be well-prepared
      for a rewarding career in software development.

    <h3>My Goal for the School of Engineering Program</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      I intend to pursue the Python track for my backend engineering program due
      to Python's versatility and extensive applications in geospatial software
      development, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Python have a
      wide range of spatial extensions, such as Geopandas, Fiona, Shapely, and
      Folium, which provide robust tools for geospatial data analysis and
      visualization. With Python's simplicity and flexibility, I aim to
      transition into a backend engineering role where I can leverage my skills
      to develop innovative geospatial solutions and software. By combining
      Python's geospatial capabilities with backend engineering principles, I
      intend to solve complex geospatial problems and create impactful
      applications that drive positive change.
